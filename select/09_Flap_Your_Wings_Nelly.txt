It's summertime and I'm back again
Then went to VA-yo and got my friends
Say wassup, Pharrell (these motherfuckers, Nel)

A hundred thou' couldn't get ya one of these (not one of these)
I guarantee it ain't a flaw in one of these (in one of these)
Two hundred thou' couldn't get you in the league
And three hundred thou' you couldn't even buy the keys
I think ya need to add fifty more G's
Now shall I proceed? (Yes indeed)
Ho, I need to see ya take it down to the floor
Spread your wings if you're real, ma, fly real low
Pause for a second, ma, grind real slow
And if you do it right Rodeo we'll go
Ho, I talk a lil' Fred Siegel girl
Bonnie and Judy Lee but with ya bag all Vida, girl
Apple Bottom with La Pearl underneath it
You talkin' like you don't need it, I can tell ya conceited

O.P.P. time, now let's get naughty
You take baby girl and I'ma take shorty
With the sweat drippin' all over her body
We gon' move if you wanna (oh), groove if you wanna (oh)
Fly ya nose up, ma, and get rude if you wanna
Ain't got nothin' to lose nor to prove
Baby girl soakin' like she just got up out the pool, yeah
I know you're thirsty ma, go 'head and order what you want
Some call it trickin', go 'head and call it what you want
I came to ball, I ain't come out here to front
'Cause the black card'll pickup what the grey card won't
Her attractiveness, got me attackin' this
Oh so fabulous, gluteus maximus
She wanna fly south for the winter (for the winter)
I might just go down south just to win her (just to win her)
Hell naw, she ain't gon leave me alone
Makin' plans for us to be at home
Take your pants off, ma, you can leave your panties on

Come on flap your wings, come on flap your wings
To the girls wit' extensions to the girls wit' dreads (woah, woah, woah)
Come on flap your wings, come on flap your wings
From the girls got it good livin' in the suburbs (woah, woah, woah)
Come on flap your wings, come on flap your wings
To the ones in the ghetto wit' their hands on their curves (woah, woah, woah, woah)
Come on flap your wings, come on flap your wings, oh
