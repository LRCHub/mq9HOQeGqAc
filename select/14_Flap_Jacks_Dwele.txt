What is a flapjack?

Buh duh da dah duh dah duh, buh duh da dah duh dah duh, buh da dah duh duh duh, dah dah da da
I'm digging them flapjacks [x2]

[Verse 1:]
If I got a girlfriend, you got a boy friend, we've got a love thing everything is right
Funny how some things work out soon as you acknowledge it
What we got is smooth all we gotta do is polish it
I gotta love you, you gotta love me
We gotta be fuckin be what we wanted to
Believe that I got plans to hold you down
I can see a future in, this being A-shot team

[Hook:]
I gotta want you, you gotta want me, we gotta want the best of love
I already want you, you already want me, we gotta love thing, we gotta love thing
I gotta need you, you gotta need me, we gotta want the best of love
I already need you, you already need me, we gotta love thing, we gotta love thing

[Verse 2:]
Is this a rap song, or is it vocals, am I hip hop or neo-soul
Baby it don't matter just as long as you loving it
It's gon be the same thing that it was when you discovered it
Music in a lot of ways mimics relationships,
It gets tainted when you bring rules into it
Believe I'm trying to free your mind,
Respect my light, I'll respect yours, and...

[Hook]

HO!, I- I've gotta love thing
We -e need to elate
I said we need to elate (skat)
Love thing!
Hey!
Said we need to elate
Ho oh oh oh oh for real, elate

[Verse 3:]
I watched your friend get out of that car
I promised that I'd get that
And All I could think when I saw you at the bar
Was caking up with them flapjacks
But now that I know your past, beauty, and face
You've changed where my thought process is at
But I would be wrong if I didn't state...
Damn you got some good flapjacks!

[Vamp:]
